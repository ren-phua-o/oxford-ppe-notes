- Dasgupta and Stiglitz "argue that except in the short run both market structure and the nature of inventive activity are endogenous; that the degree of concentration in an industry ought not to be treated as given, as it recently has been in the industrial organisation literature; that they both depend on more basic ingredients, such as the technology of research, demand conditions, the nature of the capital market (i.e. market rates of interest, and the ability of firms to borrow to finance research and development), and the legal structure (e.g. patent rights)." (p. 267) The relationship between market structure and the nature of inventive activity ought not to be regarded as causal.
