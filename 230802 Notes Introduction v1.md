# Notes Introduction
I am Ren (PPE, 2023). These are notes and exercises that I have written and completed during the course of my undergraduate study. It is my hope that these will be of use to future cohorts of Oxford undergraduates.

I graduated with First Class Honours, and achieved the following marks at the Second Public Examination. (Overall rank remains undisclosed due to the marking and assessment boycott.)

|Paper|Mark|Highest Mark in Cohort|
|---|---|---|
|Microeconomics|84 ü•à|85|
|Quantitative Economics|77|Undisclosed|
|Economics of Industry|74 ü•à|75|
|Game Theory|91 ü•á|91|
|Microeconomic Analysis|80 ü•á|80|
|Ethics|73|82|
|Nicomachean Ethics|72|75|
|Philosophical Logic|83 ü•á|83|

## Comments on Options

|Paper|Difficulty|Comments|
|---|---|---|
|Microeconomics|2/5 ‚úî|A common option and a necessary pre-requisite for Economics of Industry, Game Theory, and Microeconomic Analysis, which were enjoyable and manageable papers. Microeconomics is also a much easier paper for students who have completed those three options.|
|Quantitative Economics|3/5 ‚ûñ|A common option that is essential for further academic work, and with some application in industry.|
|Economics of Industry|2/5 ‚úî|A very enjoyable paper with some application in industry. The scope of examinable content is reasonable and well-defined, but marks are awarded in a very narrow band.|
|Game Theory|2/5 ‚úî|A very enjoyable paper.|
|Microeconomic Analysis|4/5 ‚ùó|A relatively challenging paper. Requires mathematical competence.|
|Ethics|3/5 ‚ûñ|A necessary but still enjoyable paper for students reading Philosophy. To score well, it is necessary to be somewhat tactical in topic/question selection, and to have friends to discuss Ethics with.|
|Nicomachean Ethics|4/5 ‚ùó|A relatively challenging paper, but a less abstract, and more manageable (I suspect) alternative to Knowledge and Reality. I suspect that these notes will greatly reduce the difficulty of this paper.|
|Philosophical Logic|5/5 ‚ùó|An extremely challenging paper. This paper, we suspect, is attempted only by students who scored extremely well in first year Logic. The exam requires not only mastery of the content, but ingenuity to solve unfamiliar problems. The exam is harshly set but generously marked.|
