# Philosophical Logic Notes Introduction
James Studd's notes are excellent and these notes serve primarily to condense those. I suspect that the most helpful files in this folder will be the past paper attempts, the "Reading" notes, and the philosophical notes. I prepared for all topics except Simple Quantified Modal Logic, Variable Domain Quantified Modal Logic, and Two-Dimensional Logic.

The Philosophical Logic exam must be approached very tactically. The technical parts of each question are high-variance, and often include unfamiliar problems that require not only mastery of the course content, but ingenuity to solve. This means that to score well, it is necessary to (1) ace the philosophical parts of each question, which are, we suspect, generously marked and often neglected by students, and (2) make some attempt at the unfamiliar technical problems for which partial credit will be given. The examiners repeatedly emphasise that a failure to attempt all parts of a question is the most common explanation of a poor result.
