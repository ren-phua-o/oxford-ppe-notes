# Ethics Notes Introduction
I prepared in full for Well-Being, Virtue Ethics, and Contractualism. Additionally, I prepared for some sub-topics of Options and Demandingness (related to consequentialism) and Authority of Morality. The "Notes" present the common dialectics for each topic, and the "Reading" notes are meant to accompany or summarise the prescribed primary readings. Understanding and memorising the "Notes" should be sufficient for writing a competent tutorial essay. Exam questions sometimes do not ask about the familiar dialectics, and will require strong philosophical instincts to answer.
